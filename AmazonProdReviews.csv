0,It's travel friendly and heats up quickly. The swivel cord is long enough to use without discomfort. It doesnâ€™t have heat adjustment setting other than a switch on & off button. Would prefer if it came with a travel heat cover along with the straightener; But nevertheless great purchase for its price.,Straightener,4.0

14,"Don't compare this to a hair straightener, if you want frizz free hair with some clean straighten look this is for you, also don't forget to apply heat protection and try to avoid using while your hair is still wet or damp you feel like you're burning your hair plus it takes lot of time to style and won't get up to mark",Straightener,3.0
15,"I'm so happy to finally try the Bblunt hair straightening brush. The brush heats up to 220 Degree. However, I can still touch the bristles, which means there's no risk of burning myself. Secondly, my hair is not curly but wavy. And it takes me less than 10 minutes to straighten my hair. Don't expect to get pin straight hair. Instead, you will get natural looking straight hair with adequate volume. The hair doesn't fall flat like normally happens when using hair straightner. The result lasts till the next wash. I always use heat protectant.The only con that I have noticed is that there's a weird rubbery smell when I heat the brush. Though the smell doesn't transfer to my hair, it's disturbing. I've not noticed any difference in performance due to the smell. But if Bblunt can take this into consideration, it would be great to not have that smell.",Straightener,4.0

18,"It only works on straight hairs , not straights the hair properly its better to buy a straightener",Straightener,2.0
19,"Before buying this product, know that this is a smoothening brush and not a straightener and it does its job VERY well.",Straightener,5.0
20,The left side is straightened by the BBlunt brush and the right side is my natural wavy hair...Get straight hair within 10 mins...Needs to be used on 95% dry hair with a heat protected serum...Leaves the hair feeling really soft and shiny..Its a great product...,Straightener,4.0
21,Good one ðŸ‘,Straightener,4.0
22,Tried short and long hairs with bblunt hair spray. Not satisfied with this product. No long lasting even 10 minutes.,Straightener,1.0
23,This brush straight your hair easily but it is not long lasting. During summers the straight hair will last only 3 to 4 hours. You need to use brush daily. You can invest if u have plain hair. Fir weavy hair I donâ€™t think straightening will last for more than 2 hours,Straightener,3.0
24,"Straightens your hair but doesnt stay long at all. Use heat protectant spray, but be careful, make sure the spray is dried completely. If hair is wet even a little it burns your hair. You need to comb in such a way that your hair touches the inner part of brush, other wise it wont work.",Straightener,2.0
